    <div>  Janina and jannatul really like dessert....maybe a little too much.They tend them thinking themselves as dessert specialist
      costantly testing,researching and eating their way through dessert nostalgia.They spend a large amount their free time in balery.
      pursuing her professional dreams of baking ,jannatul spent her days is a lifeless cubicle space filled with memos and meetings.
      when the company she was working for offerd her s buyout, she took the money and ran straight to Ottowa,where she earned her pastry
      diploma.She works in several bakeries and kitchens across the city . she was also an instructor at the  Bonnie Gordon College of 
      Confectionary Arts.

      Janina ,on the other hand ,dabbled with the idea of becoming a teacher, She tried to focus on her school work, but all her dreams of
      flour and sugar kept knocking at her door. She attended George Brown College,followed by The cake desighner certificate at The Bonnie
      Gordon College of Confectionary Arts.

      Janntul and Janina  Crosssed paths at the Bonnie Gordon School and formed a bond over their love of flour and sugar.the rest is History!
